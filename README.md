# Abstract:
Within the umbrella of COVID-19 - but not restricted to – we have developed computational programs, android apps and other computational and fundamental-science tools, which involve CERN-based ROOT codes in C++, Python, FORTRAN, Monte Carlo simulations, etc. These are based on simple epidemiological models that we have developed to follow the evolution of COVID-19 coronavirus worldwide following official data from Worldometer:
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus 
Our paper has been published in the prestigious journal Applied Mathematical Modelling and is now part of the Elsevier Public Health Emergency Collection:

The overall program encompasses the fields of epidemiology, modeling, computation, mathematics, biology and physics. The different tools we have developed will be presented during the workshop. Some have already been implemented at the Universities of Pretoria, Western Cape, Nelson Mandela, Venda and Zululand. This
mini-workshop is open to any undergrad and postgrad students from any South African and international universities and institutions who wish to join.
